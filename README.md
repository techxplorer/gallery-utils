# Gallery Utils

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/techxplorer/gallery-utils/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

This is a CLI app that I've developed which helps to build my [photo gallery][pg]
website. It also provides a space for me to explore development using [Node.js][nj]
outside of work.

The script works with a, yet to be released, custom [Hugo][h] theme that I
am developing.

## Commands ##

There are three commands provided by the app.

### photo-pages

The `photo-pages` command creates individual photo pages for each
photo in albums that are part of the website.

### import-photos
The `import-photos` command imports new photos from an Instagram archive into
albums that are part of the website. This is the easiest way that I've found to
add photos from my Instagram account into the gallery.

### help
The `help` command lists brief help about the commands available.
